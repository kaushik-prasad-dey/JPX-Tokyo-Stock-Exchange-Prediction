Success in any financial market requires one to identify solid investments. When a stock or derivative is undervalued, it makes sense to buy. If it's overvalued, perhaps it's time to sell. While these finance decisions were historically made manually by professionals, technology has ushered in new opportunities for retail investors. Data scientists, specifically, may be interested to explore quantitative trading, where decisions are executed programmatically based on predictions from trained models. In this competition, financial data for the Japanese market will be provided, allowing retail investors to analyze the market to the fullest extent.

Japan Exchange Group, Inc. (JPX) is a holding company operating one of the largest stock exchanges in the world, Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), and derivatives exchanges Osaka Exchange (OSE) and Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM). JPX is hosting this competition and is supported by AI technology company AlpacaJapan Co., Ltd.

This competition will involve building portfolios from the stocks eligible for predictions. Specifically, each participant ranks the stocks from highest to lowest expected returns and is evaluated on the difference in returns between the top and bottom 50 stocks. You'll have access to financial data from the Japanese market, such as stock information and historical stock prices to train and test your model. After the training phase is complete, the competition will compare your models against real future returns.

The training data begins in January 2017 with about 1,860 stocks with new stocks added through December 2020 for a total of 2,000 stocks. Below is a brief overview and descriptive statistics of the variables in the training data.
